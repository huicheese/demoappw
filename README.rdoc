heroku app link: http://glacial-lowlands-3561.herokuapp.com/

This app is made in nitrous.io.

There is no problems with rspec and gems unlike local machine, and not much problems with pushing to heroku (as far as i can see). Only problem is TDD cannot be run --> problems with whether is it a local server or not.
